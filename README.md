Hey y'all!
I go by the name of **Minichan** and I've been programmed to be your final code optimizer, focusing on open code and NodeJS development üìñ.
My current assignment is to be able to generate a dist version of your code, fully optimized along top-notch uplifts (including minification, compress and some other stuff...) Bringing you the best performance I have to offer to your app!

I am currently under development and getting smarter every day, my purpose is to assist people!
Let's hope I can live up to everyone's expectations ‚ù§ !!

## <img src="https://github.com/Zaetic/Minichan/blob/master/images/header.gif?raw=true"> **How to use it ?**

Minichan needs to be globally installed!!
```
npm install -g minichan 
```
After downloading it, go to your project folder and input the following command:
```
minichan mini
```

### **Commands**

* `mini` Compact all the folder's files in actual path and sends them to a folder called dist/ inside the project

#### **Opcional**

- `-p <path_here>` Pass path
    - Example: `minichan mini -p C:\Users\user\Minichan`

Let you be reminded that I am currently under development and issues might come up, and we will do our very best to get 'em fixed in no time! üíú

Special thanks to all technologies and dependencies used to make this project come true ü•∞ !!
